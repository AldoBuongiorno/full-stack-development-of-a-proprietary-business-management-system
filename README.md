# full-stack-development-of-a-proprietary-business-management-system
This project represents the work carried out for my Bachelor’s thesis in Computer Engineering at the University of Salerno, developed during an internship at MAGUSA S.R.L.

The objective was to develop a section of the company’s management system dedicated to warehouse order handling (Direct Fulfillment), featuring an interface optimized for tablet devices and non-technical operators.

The project follows an MVC architecture and adopts a full-stack approach using the following technologies:

Frontend: Angular, Bootstrap

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA

Database: PostgreSQL

Cloud: Document upload to AWS S3

The main order management workflows (acceptance, rejection, shipment) have been implemented, ensuring operation traceability and a responsive user interface.
For more details, please refer to the thesis PDF attached to this repository.
